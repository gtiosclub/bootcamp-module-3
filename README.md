# Module 3: Enums, Structs, Classes


In this module, we'll go over enums, structs, and classes.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repo into your own Github account and clone the forked
repo onto your local device.

Refer to [module 0](https://github.com/gtiosclub/bootcamp-module-0) for
instructions on how to do so.

Once you've cloned the repo, open the CarsApp project using Xcode if you
haven't already.

## Intro

In this module, you'll be building the logic for a fun Car Catalog App! This app presents the user with a list of available cars, and relevant information about each one. The UI has already been created for you, so please don't change any of it.

## TODO

Within CarsApp, go to the TODO folder and complete parts 1-3 based on the provided instructions. Complete the parts in the correct order, as the instructions are worded with that in mind.

Once you finish all parts, run the application using Cmd+R. The simulator takes a while to run, so don't worry if the simulator opens and is stuck with a blank screen. The blank screen will go away if you stay patient.

If any errors appear when attempting to run the app, it's probably because of one of the following reasons:
- You have a mistake in your code. Find it and fix it.
- You haven't selected the development account you will use for this project. If that's the case, open the side bar on the left, look at the folders hierarchy and find the CarsApp directory at the top-most level (with an appstore logo beside it). Click on that. Next, click on CarsApp under "Targets". Open the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Next to "Team", select your account from the dropdown menu.

## Submission

Make sure you have committed and pushed your local changes to the remote repo, so that we can see your work when we access this link. Refer to module-0 and the Git slides from Day 2 if you are having trouble, or reach out via Discord.

To submit your work, paste the link for the forked repo next to your name under Week 3 &rarr; Assignment of the Student Dashboard (Notion). Make sure you are logged into your Notion account, otherwise you won't have edit permissions.
